Things to mention:
* Talk about using `vercel/serve` vs an `nginx` web server - the latter provides more configuration, but may be too heavy duty at this stage. You might rely on your CDN/API gateway to do what nginx would normally do.
* Talk about at what stage you've built this application (e.g. going from local dev to multi-dev, proving the idea with a larger market)
* Using Revolut virtual cards for cloud providers
* Forking off of an SSO protected org repo (even if it's public) means any PRs will require SSO (this feels like a bug)
* Initial Terraform plan will not run in the cloud automatically - you need to merge the directory with the repo in first, run a manual apply and then any subsequent changes to that directory will through VCS will get picked up automatically
* The fly.toml for the DB needs to correctly reference the DB name, a region and the the volume created for the DB
* flyctl does not have good secrets management - you have to use a CLI to create a secret (which requires creating an ephemeral terminal to set secrets)
* Mention how we can use Makefiles to automate more
* Creating a Fly DB using their HA doc lead to a load of bugs - their provider is also outdated (creating DBs using Nomad rather than machines). Using MongoDB instead.
* Terrform CLI is very intuitive with Terraform cloud. Only problem is that the token is exposed in a file, need to be careful with that!
* Tainting resources has to be done from the CLI
